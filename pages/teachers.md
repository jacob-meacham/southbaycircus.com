<h3>Christina "Nova" GoOutski</h3>
Christina "Nova" GoOutski was introduced to prop manipulation and flow arts by a small band of performing carnies in the northeastern U.S. She learned her first juggling and club spinning skills from Kinko and Mistress Philomena of the Bindlestiff Family Cirkus and their extended community in upstate New York. She lit her first fire poi with the Albany Spin Jam community. From there, she moved to the heartland, where she connected with members of Pyrotechnique performance troupe (based in Chicago), and the Iowa City Flow Tribe. She has enjoyed the distinct pleasure of spinning all of the things with all sorts of people, in all sorts of places, all over the country, and she loves being able to share with others everything that her friends and teachers have shared with her.

<h3>Cosmo</h3>
After forty years in the entertainment industry, Cosmo has reached a high enough level of skill to only need his first name to be recognized. He has performed on screen, on stage, and as a street performer. His list of skills include juggling, unicycling, mime, balloon animals, and whip cracking (to name a few). He has lent his skills to the video game industry where he can be seen (virtually) fighting beasts and as a dancing bear. He has shared many of his skills with others ranging from the beginner to the seasoned professional. He enjoys teaching as much as he does performing.

<h3>Jacob Meacham</h3>

Jacob's first began finding body awareness during rock climbing competitions. A lot later, he applied the same tenacity he used for clinging to walls to keep his partners from falling off of his hands. Jacob teaches Partner Acrobatics, dabbles in Partner Juggling, and would love to try Partner trapeze (notice a pattern?) By day, you can find Jacob programming - he loves game development and web development (like this site) - and most of the rest of the time, you can find him either balancing someone else on his body, or helping others do the same.

<h3>Jessica Goodburn</h3>

Jessica started her circus training doing floor routines in a USA leotard in her backyard. Her love of being upside down and movement led her to BA in Modern Dance at the University of Oregon and eventually to practicing Partner Acrobatics with her boyfriend, Jacob. Jessica believes that the flier plays an active role in the execution and safety of acrobatic movements, and she draws heavily on her background in dance and contact improvisation to create new movements and help students refine old ones. In addition to Partner Acrobatics, Jessica can teach Flexibility and Dance for Circus Artists. She is also a Certified Pilates Instructor.

<h3>Miriam Robinson Gould</h3>
Miriam fell in love with aerial dance by way of theater when a role required her to learn aerial rope tricks. Determined to learn more after the show ended, she studied aerial silks with <a href="http://bluelapislight.org/">Blue Lapis Light</a>, Austin's site-specific aerial dance troupe. She has since taken flight for the Jezebelles go-go dance troupe, CircX Vortex, BootieSF, and <a href="http://fire.firepixie.com/">Fire Pixie Entertainment</a>, performing aerial hammock, aerial net, and solo and duet aerial silks. She is excited to help a new generation of students learn to fly.

<h3>Soo Hom</h3>
Soo Hom has been juggling and teaching juggling for over ten years. She first learned to juggle from a co-worker. This skill brought her to other jugglers, to other circus arts, and eventually to her husband, Cosmo, who she met while taking classes at Cirque San Jose. She and Cosmo performed juggling together in Cirque San Jose productions. Sadly, the studio is no longer present. Her love for circus and theater arts has grown over the years and has expanded to aerial tissu, acroyoga, and poi.
