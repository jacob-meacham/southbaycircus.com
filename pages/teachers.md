<h3>Jessica Goodburn</h3>

Jessica started her circus training doing floor routines in a USA leotard in her backyard. Her love of being upside down and movement led her to BA in Modern Dance at the University of Oregon and eventually to practicing Partner Acrobatics with her boyfriend, Jacob. Jessica believes that the flier plays an active role in the execution and safety of acrobatic movements, and she draws heavily on her background in dance and contact improvisation to create new movements and help students refine old ones. In addition to Partner Acrobatics, Jessica teaches Flexibility and Dance for Circus Artists. She is also a Certified Pilates Instructor.
