title: Indiegogo goes out with a bang
published: 2013-04-03

Wow! Thank you all so much! 70 backers, $5,361 for training equipment. I think we can call this a success!

Yesterday, you all brought in around $2,000 in less than 24 hours. We'd be lying if we said we weren't a touch overwhelmed, but now we're back to our senses and ready to start working on the perks and getting some of this equipment for you to come play on!

Here is a partial list of the equipment that you've helped us get:

- More aerial silks, so that everyone has more time in the air
- Almost 1000 square feet of gymnastics mats, to help us fall safely and enable us to teach even cooler tricks
- An acrobatic spotting harness, for flying tricks
- More juggling balls, clubs, knives, torches
- More poi, hoops, fire fans
- A circus walking ball
- ...And tons of other fun toys!

Thanks again, from everyone at SBCA!
