title: Indiegogo goes out with a bang
published: 2013-04-03

Wow! Thank you all so much! 70 backers, $5,361 for training equipment. I think we can call this a success!

Yesterday, you all brought in around $2,000 in less than 24 hours. We'd be lying if we said we weren't a touch overwhelmed, but now we're back to our senses and ready to start working on the perks and getting some of this equipment for you to come play on!
