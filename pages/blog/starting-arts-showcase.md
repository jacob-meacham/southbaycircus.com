<img src="/static/img/blog/rehearsal2.jpg" class="blog-image" style="float: left; max-width: 250px">We started work on a new acro piece last night, to be performed at the Starting Arts Showcase on April 20th. Last night's rehearsal got us through most of the structure and we'll have a few more chances to whip it into shape before it goes on stage next weekend. Quick turnover, but it's always good to have a deadline!

Performers willing, we're hoping to take this to farmer's markets and public spaces this spring, or fit it into a longer show in the summer. 

[You can come see these guys perform](/http://hosted-p0.vresp.com/624606/346beecc52/ARCHIVE/) along with some other guest artists and very talented high schoolers on April 20th at 7pm. Tickets are $10 at the door. And if you're wanting to perform yourself, come to a class! We'll have lots of fun performance opportunities coming up!
