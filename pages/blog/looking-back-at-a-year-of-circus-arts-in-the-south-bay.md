A little over a year ago, Jessica, Jacob, and I began the South Bay Circus Arts meetup with a belief that if there were enough people interested in circus arts to support multiple schools and boutique circuses in the East Bay and San Francisco, there must be at least a handful of people in the South Bay. Today, the meetup group has grown to over 200 members. We've found jugglers, unicyclists, aerialists, hoopers, prop manipulators, sword balancers, whipcrackers, knife throwers, acrobats, and cyr wheel spinners. Members have taught workshops on handstands, flexibility improvement, whip making, juggling, aerial conditioning, hooping, and even balloon twisting. We've performed as a group for SubZero and San Jose's First Friday Art Walk and as individual performers at various events.

But more than the skill exchanges and performances, what's really exciting is to see the South Bay create a circus arts community of its own. We aren't just united by training together, performing together, or teaching and learning from each other. We're united by the friendship that comes from pushing the limits of the possible together. 

We have big dreams for the coming year, and if you're reading this post, it means you're interested in circus arts in some form. So take a class or a workshop with us. Come to one of the circus jams that people within the group host. Dive in and learn that it's never too late to join the circus.
