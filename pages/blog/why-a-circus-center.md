*"A circus center,"* you say, *"but why, and when, and what does that mean anyway?"*  Our current situation allows us to test drive some classes, play with scheduling, and get a sense for what will work best. It's a great place to start. However, with the [indiegogo campaign](http://igg.me/at/sbca/), we have our eyes on the next step: a dedicated circus center.

Sometime in the next year, when we feel confident we can cover rent and other monthly expenses, we plan to lease a studio or warehouse space so that we can host all of our activities in the same place. 

*So, what's in it for this community?* Here are some things we can think of: 

<img src="/static/img/blog/latenightacro.jpeg" class="blog-image" style="float: left; max-width: 250px">**More class options.** Morning and evening. Beginning, intermediate, advanced. More fitness and dance. More aerial specialization. The places where we rent are busy with their own schedules and we're lucky to have the times we do! We can't wait to be able to mix things up a little more.

**More low-cost options.** Open gyms, member-only open gyms, reserveable training space, member-led advanced training sessions. This will be an awesome thing about having our own space that we just can't support at this point.

**A place to hold skill shares that isn't Jessie and Jacob's living room!** As much as I love having people upside down in the living room, it's not ideal. We plan to continue skill shares at their same low cost at the circus center as a super-cheap way for people to get their feet wet.

**Safety.** Having our own space would allow us to control the surroundings more.

**A place to host out-of-town teachers.** We'd love to bring in out-of-town instructors. Several of us went to [Niko Douwes' workshop](/blog/what-goes-up-must-come-down/) in Santa Cruz, and we were challenged and exposed to new ideas and drills. There are so many talented teachers with things to share. We want to bring them right to our hometown! 

**A performance venue.** Performance venues can be expensive to rent and do not always have rigging capabilities. Our own circus center would allow us to hold more performances, small and large scale, giving more people in the community a chance to perform. We would also open this space to members of our community who have their own performance projects or companies.

**Kid's classes.** While we'll be doing some outreach through the Starting Arts summer camp and potentially, some private kids classes, a kid's program won't be able to really take off until we can host it in our own center.

**A fun and social environment that can morph to community needs.** Once we have our own space, we hope to welcome the influence of the artistic and recreational community in the South Bay.

*Your contribution to indiegogo helps us reach this goal by outfitting us with the first equipment we'll need to open a center. (We'll be using it in our current classes, but it will move with us to the center as well.) If we make enough, we can get sound and lighting equipment for outdoor performances. Contributions also help us have confidence that there is a want for a circus center in this area. We're thrilled at the support so far. Please help us in our final push toward our end goal!*
