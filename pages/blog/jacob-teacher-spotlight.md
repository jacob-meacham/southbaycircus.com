**Meet Jacob Meacham**, one of our partner acrobatics teachers and a co-founder of South Bay Circus Arts. In addition to acrobatics, Jacob is working on his juggling skills. He teaches Partner Acrobatics, Levels 1 and 2 for SBCA. I sat down with him to chat about the circus and teaching acrobatics.

####How did you get into partner acrobatics?
My girlfriend and I used to live in Oregon and we had been taking yoga classes. Somebody after class made an announcement that there was an AcroYoga thing going on and we went home and watched videos and we thought it looked fun. And then we went to the class and met our first acro teachers, YogaSlackers Jason and Chelsey and we’ve been hooked ever since. We’ve sort of moved away from the yoga part since our love for it was for the acrobatics, so we teach and perform from that standpoint, now.

####What is your movement background?
I began my movement training with rock climbing. I rock climbed competitively when I was in high school and a lot of the same things that make someone a good rock cllimber (tenacity, awareness of where your body weight is) makes someone a good acrobat. In college, I did some gymnastics, dance, and yoga as well.

####What unique offering do you have as an acrobatics teacher?
Along with my acrobatic partner, Jessie, I think that our class offers a lot of body awareness work. We try to stay away from the trap of just finding static poses and instead get people to examine the underlying mechanics of the movement. I think our beginner’s class is especially unique because we use contact improv techniques to teach safety and promote fluid movement.

####What are you currently working on in your own practice?
We’re starting to play with introducing musicality and theatricality into our routines, so moving away from a gymnastics style and toward something more like [Pilobolus](http://www.pilobolus.com).

####Why are you a part of SBCA?
When I told circus friends from Oregon I was moving to the South Bay, they said the circus community was really awesome. When we got to the South Bay we found that there is a vibrant community in San Francisco as well as in Santa Cruz, but there isn’t one here. I found that there are pockets of amazing talent, but nothing centralized, so South Bay Circus Arts gives all of us in the South Bay an opportunity to build a community that is as lively as those surrounding us without having to leave our front doors.

####What’s one circus skill that you’d you’d love to try, but haven’t yet?
I’d love to do the chinese pole. The strength that takes is just awesome, and it's such a cool way to get up off the ground without using aerial apparatus.
