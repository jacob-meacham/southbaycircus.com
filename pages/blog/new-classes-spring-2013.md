We will be offering classes next month at two South Bay locations. Our current classes include juggling, hooping, club and poi spinning, cyr wheel, aerial arts, and acrobatics! Check out the [classes page](/classes/) for details on schedule and pricing. 

Is there some other circus art you’re dying to try that isn't on our list yet? [Send us a message](/contact/) and let us know what class you’d love to take! We are happy to expand our offerings if we know there is interest.
