I'm always impressed by the first time circus artists who come to our events. Even when you have a sense of the group from seeing pictures on meetup or watching a jam in the park, there is always that hurdle between thinking something looks fun and actually getting up the chutzpah to go and try it out. 

The fun thing about first-timers, adults in particular, is that they are almost always surprised by what they can do. It's easy for kids: they just come right up and start shooting questions, asking to try things. But adults have preconceived notions about their abilities. We'll often hear, "I'm not very flexible" or "I have no upper body strength. Are you sure I can do that?"  

One of our favorite things about teaching circus arts is that with the right equipment and a little instruction, people end up with skills they never thought they'd have: gorgeous poses on aerial silks, shoulderstands on a partner's feet, the ability to walk on a slackline. People of all ages, fitness levels, and backgrounds have gotten hooked and keep coming back for more training, which is when things really get fun.

So, if you're one of the many who tried circus arts on a whim, thanks for being brave and taking the chance! And if you've never tried, but are tempted by what you see, we hope to see you soon, especially if you have never been able to keep a hula hoop around your hips. With that one, we're pretty confident we can help--we see that all the time!  

*There's no time like the present to try circus arts. We have [classes starting in March!](/classes/)*
