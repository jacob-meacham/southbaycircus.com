An aerial hoop is a metal hoop suspended vertically in the air. Aerialists use the hoop to spin and wrap themselves in graceful poses. Elise will guide you through entrances, poses, spins, and descents in a safe environment with mats and sprung flooring. Long sleeves and pants/leggings/tights are recommended to protect your skin.
