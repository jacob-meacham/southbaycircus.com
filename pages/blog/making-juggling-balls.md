This weekend's project was making the juggling balls for all of you Indiegogo supporters who wanted The Flourish or The Dog and Pony Show. Because one of the things I love about the circus is the chance to learn new skills, we decided to make the balls from scratch and screen print our logo onto them.

The blank balls are very easy to make but feel great as practice balls (not too bouncy like a tennis ball, but not too soft like a hacky sack). The basic recipe comes from our instructors, Soo and Cosmo. To make a set, you'll need:

* Birdseed: We've found that the best birdseed is small and uniform -- at the store near us, this was sold as the finch mix.
* Plastic baggies: You'll need 3 of the type used for storing sandwiches for each set you want to make. You don't want the expensive zip lock kind, just the cheap fold-overs.
* Round 11-12 inch helium-grade balloons: 9 for each set you want to make
* Scissors

First, cut the tops off of your balloons. It takes a bit of experimentation to find the best place to make your cut. You want to cut right at the base of the neck, leaving a small hole but no extra material that will bunch up.

Next, take one of your plastic baggies and fill it with about 1/2 cup of birdseed. You can use as little as 1/3 cup, or as much as 2/3 cup -- it all depends on your hand size, but we find that 1/2 cup is a great size for practicing with.

Now, fold the baggie over, twist up the top and then fold that twist so that you have a little ball.

Here comes the hard part. Stretch your first balloon over the baggie. Try to get a uniform stretch across the whole balloon so that there are no weak spots later on. Take the next balloon and stretch it over the whole package, making sure to cover up the hole left by the first balloon. Finally, take the third balloon and stretch it over everything, again making sure to cover up the hole.

Since we were going to be screen printing each ball, we only put on two balloons and left the third off while we got our screen printing frame ready. One of the coolest ways to do screen printing is to use the photo emulsion technique, which uses a coating that hardens when exposed to light and a transparency with your design on it. Of course, we baked the SBCA logo into our screen, so besides juggling balls, we're also all ready to print up shirts, signs, or anything else that needs a logo!

After the screen was prepared, we set up an assembly line to print on all 45 balloons. We stretched the balloons over some 3 inch lids to keep our surface flat (they came from the tape we used for the hoops!). I would spread ink on the screen, and then put it on a blank and do the print. Jessie would take the print and set it in our drying area, and prepare another blank.

In the background you can see the finished prints still in the drying area, and the one that we just printed underneath the frame. Not all of the prints were perfect, so we get to keep a few balls for ourselves, and all of you who have been eagerly awaiting your practice juggling balls should be receiving them soon!
