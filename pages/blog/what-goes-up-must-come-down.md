Niko started his workshop by saying  "In tumbling you're doing a lot of landing. In partner acrobatics, we want to bring our partners to the ground." We're always working at getting these crazy poses, but then it's just as important from a performance and training standpoint, to know how to get out of them, to bring our partners safely back to land. 


Niko's workshop reminded me to not throw things away. Once you get into the shoulder stand, you don't just fall out of it. You go back the way you came, or you transition to something new, even if that means coming to the floor. So, we're issuing a challenge to ourselves: can we make all of our falls dismounts? Dismounts, where as a base, you safely bring your partner down, and as a flyer, you gracefully seek the floor. 


Beyond thoughts on training and handstand drills, the workshop gave us lots of new ways of looking at old tricks, and plenty of new things to try with our classes. We weren't at all surprised to find that Niko had a whole new basket of tricks, and we are excited to play with more Dutch-style acrobatics! 


Come try partner acrobatics with us on Sundays from 12:45--2 and Tuesdays (Intermediate class) from 7:30-9:30.
