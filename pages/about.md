#Who Are We?
<br>

####South Bay Circus Arts (SBCA) is a gathering of circus artists from many disciplines who have come together to bring circus arts classes, training opportunities, and performances to the South Bay. We also sponsor a [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/South-Bay-Circus-Arts/) to facilitate informal circus arts jam sessions (note: unless otherwise specified, SBCA does not host and is not responsible for events organized through the Meetup).
